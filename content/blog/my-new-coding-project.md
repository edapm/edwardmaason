My new coding project is called Trellis. It's a Church Management System. I decided to make it because the one we use at our church at the moment isn't maintained anymore as far as I'm aware and is built on old tech. Let's just say I would like a better one. There are quite a few out there, such as ChurchDesk, but I thought I'd challenge myself to build one.

I'm planning to build the backend with [Prisma](https://prisma.io "Prisma") and GraphQL (Nexus + Apollo probably). It will take me a while to build the API, as I've never used Prisma or GraphQL before. I haven't decided how to handle authentication yet, but I'll probably end up using Auth0, as it's just easiest. I might add payments later with Stripe, but who knows?

For the frontend, I'll probably use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org "Next.js"). I used this before with [Lunchbench](https://github.com/lunchbench/client "Lunchbench GitHub"), and quite liked it. I was going to use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev "SvelteKit"), but it's still in beta and has a smaller community.

And finally, for mobile I'm planning to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev "React Native") because I'm a web developer, I don't want to learn Kotlin and Swift and I don't want to have to build two versions of the same thing.

Let's see how this goes!

**Update**

I'm now building it with [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com "RedwoodJS"), a full stack framework combining React, Prisma and GraphQL.
