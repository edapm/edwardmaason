I have a few architectural concept projects going at the moment.

## 1. The Grieg House

![The Grieg House Concept](/images/thegrieghouse.png "The Grieg House Concept")

The idea is that it is shaped like the opening from Edvard Grieg's _Piano Concerto in A Minor_. 

## 2. "Hexagonal Star" Tower

I got a hexagon, extended the sides, added a front, and then stepped the floors to create this glass tower concept piece.

_I will add more in the future (maybe through other blog posts!_
