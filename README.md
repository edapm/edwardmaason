# My Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/06ff8358-9965-469e-8cdb-4b997af2d135/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/edwardmaason/deploys)

Hi, this is the code for my website. It's build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), so therefore it's blazing fast. It uses the [Hugo Twenty Twenty theme](https://github.com/themefisher/twenty-twenty-hugo) from [themefisher](http://www.themefisher.com), although it's [tweaked slightly](https://github.com/edapm/twenty-twenty-hugo). For a CMS, it uses [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) (it's Git-based). The site runs on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
